Although originally from New York, Olivia Lounsbury moved to the West Coast to attend school at Chapman University, pursuing a double major in Health Science and Policy and Behavioral Studies with a minor in Psychology. She has been actively involved in the Health and Space Lab since August of 2018. In addition to undergraduate education and involvement in the lab, Olivia is also the Department Coordinator for DSU at St. Joseph's hospital and a clinical intern at the Patient Safety Movement Foundation. No matter where she's working, you'll always find her with a cup of coffee in hand!
